Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV and MobileNet-SSD
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNet-SSD model. The system detects common objects such as people, cars, dogs, etc., through a webcam feed and draws bounding boxes around them in real-time.

Features
Real-time object detection with a webcam.
Lightweight MobileNet-SSD model for fast processing.
Supports detection of various common objects like cars, people, and dogs.
Customizable confidence threshold for filtering detections.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.6 or later
OpenCV (4.x.x or later)
NumPy
